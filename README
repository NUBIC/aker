Bcsec
=====

Bcsec is a library for managing authentication and authorization in
ruby applications (particularly Rack applications).  It is designed
to support the needs and work with the infrastructure of the
Northwestern University Biomedical Informatics Center.

Development environment
-----------------------

### Oracle

Part of the library provides ruby mappings for many of the tables in
NUBIC's central security schema, cc_pers.  The specs for this part of
the library require a test schema; bcsec includes rake tasks to help
you set it up.  These rake tasks have to be run on a machine with the
full Oracle client on it (the instant client is not sufficient; you
need `imp`).  Here are the steps to testing nirvana:

0. Install Oracle XE or Oracle Database (XE's easier).
1. Use `rake bcdb:create:users` to create the cc_pers_test database
   user.  The password will be "cc_pers_test".
2. Set up a bcdatabase configuration called cc_pers_test for the
   local_oracle group.
3. Use `rake test:db:import` to fill in the cc_pers_test schema.

You can run the tests on any machine that has access to your testing
oracle instance and on which you can install ruby-oci8 or jruby.
When you run the tests, you need to ensure that the `NLS_LANG`
environment variable is set to `"AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8MSWIN1252"`.
